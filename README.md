Proyecto final para Code in Place 2025: una flor interactiva que crece con clics.

#  Flower That Grows with Clicks

This is my final project for **Code in Place 2025**, a creative and interactive program made with Python using the `graphics` library. Every time you click on the canvas, a new petal appears â€” and the flower slowly grows!

## What does it do?

- Displays a canvas with a flower at the center.
- Each mouse click adds a new petal to the flower.
- The animation creates a relaxing, meditative experience.
- Shows how simple interactions (like clicks) can bring objects to life!

## How to Run

If you want to run this program on your computer:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the file (`flower.py`) in your IDE or terminal.
4. Run it:
   ```bash
   python flower.py

**What I Learned**
This project helped me practice:

Working with canvas graphics and mouse events.
Organizing code into clean, reusable functions.
Applying loops and geometry to build visual elements.
Turning a simple idea into a delightful visual interaction.
